    "*Note that this tutorial assumes basic understanding of Runhouse Functions & Modules; it is recommended that you check out [our functions and modules tutorial](https://www.run.house/docs/tutorials/api-modules) before diving into this one.* \n",
    "\n",
    "As we've discussed before, once you take a Python function or module and send it to a Runhouse cluster, the cluster holds your resource in memory, and each time that function or module is called by a client, it simply accesses it in memory and calls it. Under the hood, we have a fully asynchronous server running (FastAPI), and a separate process for each environment where your Runhouse resources live. These processes all have their own async event loops, and if you run synchronous functions on Runhouse, they are ran in a separate thread to allow for many concurrent calls to the cluster. **Note that if you are unfamiliar with asynchronous programming in Python, you should just continue using standard, Python sync functions and leave the performance to us**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Native Async Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "But, what if you're writing code that leverages Python's powerful asynchronous functionality? Luckily, we provide rich async support in a variety of ways. First off, any function that is labeled with Python's async keyword will be *executed within the async event loop*, and not within a separate thread. **This means that you should be very careful that you are not running any costly, synchronous code within an async function, to avoid blocking up your the event loop within your environment on the server. Poorly written async functions will not block the entire Runhouse daemon, but will block other functions within the same environment as the user code.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Client side, you also need to `await` a call to this function the same way you would if the function was running locally. Let's check out an example. First, we'll start a local Runhouse daemon to mess with:"

We can take the same async function I defined earlier and call it synchronously:"
